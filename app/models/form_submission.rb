#
# The FormSubmission model binds together a set of submitted answers from an adopter into a single submission. This represents a snapshot in time.
# If an adopter submits answers either through an in-app form or a third party form that is uploaded to the app,
# we will have a set of answers belonging to a form submission.
# This form submission can be valid for a period of time to allow the user to apply to adopt multiple pets.
# If this time expires, or the person's context changes and they need to update their responses, we now have a new set of answers and a new form submission.
